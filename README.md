##Setting up

###Install Ant
Ant can be installed quiet easily using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

```

```
Check ant has installed properly by running ```ant```. If you see the following after running ```ant``` then you know it has been installed successfully

```
$ ant
Buildfile: build.xml does not exist!
Build failed
```

####Setup environment variables for build process

You will need the following information to substitue in the scripts below :

- **/path/to/tomcat**  path to you systems Tomcat installation
- **connection-string** is the connection string to your database and tables for the service to use
- **connection-username** is the database username
- **connection-password** is the database users password

```
$ echo 'export TOMCAT_PATH="/path/to/tomcat"' >>~/.bash_profile
$ echo 'export DEV_CASE_TRACKER_URL="connection-string"' >> ~/.bash_profile
$ echo 'export DEV_CASE_TRACKER_USER="connection-username"' >> ~/.bash_profile
$ echo 'export DEV_CASE_TRACKER_PWD="connection-password"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

If you plan on deploying to staging and production you will need to run the following:

```
$ echo 'export STAGE_CASE_TRACKER_URL="connection-string"' >> ~/.bash_profile
$ echo 'export STAGE_CASE_TRACKER_USER="connection-username"' >> ~/.bash_profile
$ echo 'export STAGE_CASE_TRACKER_PWD="connection-password"' >> ~/.bash_profile

$ echo 'export LIVE_CASE_TRACKER_URL="connection-string"' >> ~/.bash_profile
$ echo 'export LIVE_CASE_TRACKER_USER="connection-username"' >> ~/.bash_profile
$ echo 'export LIVE_CASE_TRACKER_PWD="connection-password"' >> ~/.bash_profile

```

Now run it so its available in your current terminal

```
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```
